如果你因失去了太阳而流泪，那么你也将失去群星了。
If you shed tears when you miss the sun, you also miss the stars.

鸟儿愿为一朵云。
云儿愿为一只鸟。
The bird wishes it were a cloud.
The cloud wishes it were a bird.

我不能选择那最好的。
是那最好的选择我。
I cannot choose the best.
The best chooses me.

“海水呀，你说的是什么？”
“是永恒的疑问。”
“天空呀，你回答的话是什么？”
“是永恒的沉默。”
What language is thine, O sea?
The language of eternal question.
What language is thy answer, O sky?
The language of eternal silence.

当太阳横过西方的海面时，对着东方留下他的最后的敬礼。
The sun goes to cross the Western sea, leaving its last salutation
to the East.

你微微地笑着，不同我说什么话。而我觉得，为了这个，我已等待得久了。
You smiled and talked to me of nothing and I felt that for this
I had been waiting long.

不要因为你自己没有胃口而去责备你的食物。
Do not blame your food because you have no appetite.

使生如夏花之绚烂，死如秋叶之静美。
Let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves.

我们把世界看错了，反说它欺骗我们。
We read the world wrong and say that it deceives us.

只管走过去，不必逗留着采了花朵来保存，因为一路上花朵自会继续开放的。
Do not linger to gather flowers to keep them, but walk on,
for flowers will keep themselves blooming all your way.

不要从你自己的袋里掏出勋绩借给你的朋友，这是污辱他的。
Do not insult your friend by lending him merits from your own pocket.

不是槌的打击，乃是水的载歌载舞，使鹅卵石臻于完美。
Not hammer-strokes, but dance of the water sings the pebbles
into perfection.

如果你把所有的错误都关在门外时，真理也要被关在门外面了。
If you shut your door to all errors truth will be shut out.

世界以它的痛苦同我接吻，而要求歌声做报酬。
The world has kissed my soul with its pain, asking for its return
in songs.

鸟翼上系上了黄金，这鸟便永不能再在天上翱翔了。
Set the bird's wings with gold and it will never again soar in the sky.

我们在热爱世界时便生活在这世界上。
We live in this world when we love it.
